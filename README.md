# Lab01 - Math Game

## Description
The Math Game is a console application developed in C# as part of the Lab01 assignment. The program prompts the user to enter a number, populates an array based on the input, performs mathematical operations on the array, and displays the results.

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate proficiency in C# programming concepts such as user input, array manipulation, exception handling, and method implementation. It aims to provide a hands-on exercise in writing modular and error-handling code.

## Setup Instructions
To set up and run the Math Game program, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
3. Open the solution in an IDE or text editor of your choice.
4. Build the solution to compile the program.
5. Run the program and interact with it through the console.

## Program Execution
Upon running the Math Game program, you will be greeted with a welcome message and a prompt to enter a number greater than zero. After entering the number, you will be asked to input a series of numbers to populate an array. Once the array is populated, the program will perform calculations on the array and display the results in the console.

## Visual Representation
Here's an example of how the program may look during execution:
